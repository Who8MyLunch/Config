# node.js

Very easy to follow instructions for installing nodejs via system package manager:
- https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/

The following commands are what I recently used:

```bash
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```
