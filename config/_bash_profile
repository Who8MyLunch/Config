# ~/.bash_profile
#     - should be super-simple and just load .profile and .bashrc (in that order)
#
# ~/.profile
#     - has the stuff NOT specifically related to bash, such as environment variables (PATH and friends)
#     - anything that should be available to graphical applications OR to sh (or bash invoked as sh) MUST be in ~/.profile
#     - anything that should be available only to login shells should go in ~/.profile
#
# ~/.bashrc
#   - has anything you'd want at an interactive command line.  Command prompt, EDITOR variable, bash aliases for my use
#   - must not output anything
#
# ~/.bash_login
#   - must not exist!!!

source ~/.bashrc
source ~/.profile
